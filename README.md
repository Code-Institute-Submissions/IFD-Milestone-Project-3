## **Milestone Project 2: Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute**

The website is designed for public tourist attraction of Bmayn one of the province in the heart of Afghanistan. A short description of the province and the most ancient places to visit is introduced. It helps tourists to to find locations and
hotels around it. The main goal of this project is to provide information for the tourists who travel from other part of the world.

### **Functionality**

The Website is 5 pages. It include a main page as "Bamyan","History", "Guide", "Hotel" and "Contact". <br>
1. Bamyan page gives a short introduction of Bamyan province, a link to the activities list and google API to show the location.<br>
2. "History" page showes the history of Bamyan. <br>
3. "Guide" page gives information to tourists where to visit. <br>
4. "Hotel" page gives information about hotels and google API is used to show the locations. <br>
5. "Contact" page gives oportunity for the browserr to stablish contact. It is a contact form linked with email address. 

### **UX**

the project is designed very simple and user-friendly. I have put an image background in to the main page and 
light grey colors to the rest of the pages to keep the pages as simple as possible. The reason i put the image in 
the background is to highlight the purpose of the website. in the main page there is a link to another page
which gives information about different activities. There is also some pictures which showes different places.
In the footer i have only once link to facebook which gives the oportunity to follow us on facebook.
my user experience notes helped me a lot when i was stucking on something. my original planning and mapping
is available for review in GitHub. They are linked as follow:

### **Project expansion**

The initial focus of this project is to provide information for the travellers.
There is a huge scope for expansion to include travel services like by car or flights and also the possibility of 
linking local travel agencies to provide transportaion ease to the specific placs.

### ** Used Technologies**
+ HTML
+ CSS
+ Bootstrap 4
+ Javascript
+ JQuery
+ JSON
+ GitPod
+ GitHub
+ Google maps API
+ Google places API

### **Deployment**
The website is created in GitPod and deployed in GitHub. 
Website can be found here [i should put the link of github here] The deployed site will 
update automatically as improvements and updates are pushed to the repository from the GitPod coding platform. 
All coding and initial testing was completed in GitPod. This platform was used to write the HTML, 
CSS and JavaScript code. The display and functionality were tested using GitPod. 
I used the following process to deploy written and tested code to my GitHub repository;
+ git add -A  "to select all the changes i made".
+ git commit -m "description of commiting".
+ git push

### **Testing**
Basically testing were done in dailybases as the project build was ongoing. I have used gitpod tools to test
the look, size and functionality of the project. I have added media queries for almost all of them to control
the size of the pages both small and large screens. 
Testing was carried out as the project build was ongoing. 
Using GitPod and Google developer tools to test the look, feel and functionality of the project. 
During testing I added a media query to control the size of the map as it looked too small on larger screens. 
This suggestion came from my mentor. The website was tested on Chrome, IE, iPhone 6/7/8 and Samsung S5 as well 
as Google developer tools. The links were tested as well as the look and transformation of the presented site 
on the respective screen size/browser. I used regular pushes to the Git repository to ensure my work was saved 
and provide version control should it be necessary. During testing I used multiple CSS queries to provide the 
look and feel I wanted for all pages and to provide a consistency of font and colour scheme throughout the pages. 
I also used CSS to ensure the presentation of the images and forms provided a good UX experience for the user 
at all stages.

### **Code Credits and Personal Credits**
+ I used Bootstrap and copied the code for this and the required JS at the bottom of the page to facilitate the functionality.
+ I took the JavaScript code from fellow student Anthony Nicklin's excellent website. I deleted out additional code Anthony had which I didn't require and changed the rest as appropriate to merge and work with my site and requirements. 
+ Google searches were used to provide inspiration and hints when I found myself stuck for specific pieces of code but no code was copied directly.
+ Credit to my mentor Spencer Barriball for his expertise and tips to improve my site.
