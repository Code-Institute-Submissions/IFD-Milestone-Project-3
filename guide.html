       <p class="pDesign" style="font-size:22px;">Bamiyan was an important ancient caravan city which flourished during the days of the Silk Road.
       Many caravans from the East and the West passed through the city of Bamiyan during their journey on the Silk Road. 
       The road from Bamiyan leads to Balkh in the North, Ghazni and Kandahar in the South, Kabul and Jalalabad in the East and Herat
       in the West. The merchants in the days of Buddhism came to Bamiyan to worship and make offerings at the temples with prayers for
       the safety of their journey. Although the two Giant Buddhas of Bamiyan, which were a wonderful representation of the cultural
       heritage of the luxury and fortune of the ancient Buddhist period, they were tragically destroyed by the Taliban, which was the
       previous government in Afghanistan in 2001.</p>
       <p class="pDesign" style="font-size:22px;">Bamiyan also has many other interesting places to explore, besides the Buddhist ruins. There are remains
       of Islamic, medieval period, and also the beautiful nature of the valleys including Lake Pand: Band-i-Amir.</p>

           These blue colored lakes will suddenly appear before you as you drive up, located at a height of about 3,000m above sea level. 
           After you cross over the beautiful Shahidan pass at about 3,300m above sea level, a gentle upward slope up the hill will
           lead you there. You will have a grand view of the grassy pastures and the rare alpine plants which thrive there.</p><br /><br />
           <p class="pDesign" style="font-size:22px;"> The Band-i-Amir is also called the &quot;Pearl of the Desert&quot; because of its fantastically beautiful
           colored waters, which changes in color with the reflection of the moving sun across the sky. There are a total of 5 lakes. 
           The largest lake is Band-i-Zulufikul. Band-i-Haibat is in the center. The other lakes are Band-i-Pdina, Band-i-Panir, 
           Band-i-Graman. (Band-i-Kanbul is nearly dried up now.) There is a sacred place by Band-i-Haibat where prophet Hazrat Ali
