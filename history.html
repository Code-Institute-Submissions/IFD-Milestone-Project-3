       <p class="pDesign"> The city of Bamyan was part of the Buddhist Kushan Empire in the early centuries of the Christian era. 
       After the Kushan Empire fell to the Sassanids, Bamyan became part of the Kushansha, vassals to the Sassanids. 
       The Buddhist pilgrim Fa Xian visited Bamyan in the fifth century and recorded that the king summoned the monks of the region 
       for vows and prayers. Fa Xian also records landslides and avalanches in the mountains and the presence of snow during winter and 
       summer. This latter statement suggests climatic change which could have contributed to the historical and economic importance of 
       the area for the years to come. Another Buddhist traveller, Xuanzang, passed through Bamyan in the seventh century. 
       His record shows that the Bamiyan Buddhas and cave monastery near it were already built. He also records that Buddhism in the region
       was in decay with the people being "hard and uncultivated".[12] The Hephthalites conquered Bamyan in the 5th century. 
       After their Khanate was destroyed by the Sassanids and Turks in 565, Bamyan became the capital of the small Kushano-Hephthalite 
       kingdom until 870, when it was conquered by the Saffarids. The area was conquered by the Ghaznavids in the 11th century. 
       The Ghurid Dynasty then ruled over Bamyan during the late 12th century.[12] In 1221 the city and its population were completely 
       wiped out by Genghis Khan. The Qarlughids established their capital in the city soon thereafter. There is some evidence that Bamyan
       was somewhat populated and reconstructed during the Timurid period in the 15th century. In 1840, the region was under conflict 
       because of the First Anglo-Afghan War when the British routed Dost Mohammad Khan and his forces.[12] The first European to see Bamyan 
       was William Moorcroft (explorer) about 1824. During 1998–2001, Bamyan has been the center of combat between Taliban forces and the 
       anti-Taliban alliance; mainly Hizb-i-Wahdat – amid clashes among the warlords of local militia. Bamyan is also known as the capital of 
       Daizangi.<br>

       <p class="pDesign">On the cliff face of a mountain nearby, three colossal statues were carved 4,000 feet apart. 
       One of them was 175 feet (53 m) high standing statue of Buddha, the world's tallest. The ancient statue was carved during 
       the Kushan period in the fifth century. The statues were destroyed by the Taliban in March 2001, on the grounds that they were 
       an affront to Islam, even though they were left intact by Muslim rulers for 1200 years. Limited efforts have been made to rebuild them, 
       with negligible success. At one time, two thousand monks meditated in caves among the sandstone cliffs.[citation needed] The caves were also a big tourist attraction 
before the long series of wars in Afghanistan. The world's earliest oil paintings have been discovered in caves behind the destroyed statues. 
Scientists from the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility have confirmed that the oil paintings, probably of either walnut or poppy seed oil, 
are present in 12 of the 50 caves dating from the 5th to 9th century.[13] The murals typically have a white base layer of a lead compound, 
followed by an upper layer of natural or artificial pigments mixed with either resins or walnut or poppy seed drying oils. Possibly, 
the paintings may be the work of artists who travelled on the Silk Road.[14] The caves at the base of these statues were used by Taliban for storing weapons. After the Taliban were driven from the region, 
civilians made their homes in the caves. Recently, Afghan refugees escaped the persecution of the Taliban regime by hiding in caves 
in the Bamiyan valley. These refugees discovered a fantastic[clarification needed] collection of Buddhist statues as well as jars holding 
more than ten thousand fragments of ancient Buddhist manuscripts, a large part of which is now in the Schøyen Collection. 
This has created a sensation among scholars, and the find has been compared with the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls. 
From 2003–13, a Provincial Reconstruction Team was based in Bamyan, first manned by U.S. forces, and, since April 2003, 
by New Zealand Defence Force personnel which made up the Provincial Reconstruction Team. The 34th Division in the area, 
part of the 4th Corps, was affiliated with Karim Khalili.[15] Bamiyan was one of the first pilot centres for the Afghan 
New Beginnings Programme of Disarmament, demobilization and reintegration. On 4 July 2004 disarmament began in Bamiyan,[16] 
and on 15 July 2004 disarmament was continuing in Bamiyan including soldiers from the 34th and 35th Divisions of the then Afghan Army, 
often referred to as the Afghan Military or Militia Forces.[17].<br>

entire population of Bamyan.[18][19]

<p class="pDesign" style="margin: 10px;">Bamyan, located in the central highlands, is one of the oldest cities in the country and is widely known for the giant, ancient Buddha statues that were carved into the side of a cliff. The city of Bamyan is dominated by agriculture at 54% with only 18% of total land classified as built-up.
